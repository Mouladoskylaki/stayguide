# StayGuide — Living roadmap

## Where we are now

StayGuide is a local v0.2 prototype, not production-ready. SG-P00 is DONE as a read-only audit; Developer Experience Setup is DONE. The user reports manually verifying `npm start`, guide editing and guest rendering in VS Code. SG-P01 has been recommended but is not implemented or authorized by this documentation task. No production deployment is authorized.

Current task: **SG-DOC01 — Project Governance & Living Roadmap**, documentation and validation DONE; awaiting user review. No implementation task is IN PROGRESS. Next recommended task: **SG-P01**, limited to host state reliability, subject to explicit scope approval.

Repository snapshot for SG-DOC01: branch `main`, latest local commit `5779f84` (`chore: initialize StayGuide project`). README/progress edits and untracked `.vscode/` files from Developer Experience Setup were already present before this task. The roadmap and governance edits are also uncommitted. No fetch or push was performed; this is local Git evidence, not a claim about current remote contents.

## Mission and non-negotiable principles

Build a warm, intuitive, exceptionally fast guest guide and a simple host dashboard. Guide creation in 2–3 minutes is a measured objective, not a verified achievement. The [product specification](PRODUCT_SPEC.md) remains authoritative:

- Preserve the initial €1/property/year goal, pending payment/tax viability; no permanent free plan or feature tiers. Volume discounts remain provisional.
- Guests open a stable link or QR without an app/account, ads or per-view fees. Public guides are noindex and must not contain entry/keybox/alarm secrets.
- Keep public content lightweight, server-rendered and readable without JavaScript; no unnecessary framework or external runtime fonts/scripts.
- Preserve the signup-free trial direction, stored multilingual content from first public release, QR exports and shared-content printable welcome book requirements. Their absence in the prototype does not remove them from scope.
- Prioritize accessibility, security, performance and core functionality. Use the two [design references](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) as the warm visual direction, not evidence that photographed layouts or features already exist.
- Preserve the MVP exclusions and approval boundaries in the product specification and [agent contract](../AGENTS.md).

## Status and maintenance rules

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| DONE | Task deliverables completed with recorded verification evidence; review, commit and deployment approval are separate. |
| IN PROGRESS | Explicitly authorized task currently being worked on. |
| NEXT | Recommended next task; not authorization to start. |
| PLANNED | Defined future scope, not started; prerequisites may remain unresolved. |
| BLOCKED | A named decision, prerequisite or authorization prevents execution of the item. |

Before implementation, read this roadmap and the task definition. Execute only the user-approved ID and scope. Update status only when supported by evidence, append that evidence to [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md), and record approved decisions in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). Stop after reporting; never start NEXT automatically. Do not invent completion percentages, schedules or approvals.

## Verified baseline and completed work

Evidence is recorded in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md); historical audit and manual checks are not new tests performed by SG-DOC01.

| Item | Status | Verification evidence and limits |
|---|---|---|
| SG-P00 — read-only baseline audit | DONE | Audit report in this conversation: inventory, Git/security review, desktop/mobile screenshots, in-memory create/edit/guest/QR/card smoke checks and guest reading without JS. Direct test execution passed all 8 worker tests. No repository files changed during that task. QR decoding, physical printing and Cloudflare/D1 execution were not verified. |
| Developer Experience Setup — no task ID assigned | DONE | `.vscode/settings.json`, `.vscode/tasks.json` and README workflows exist; JSON parsed and all 8 tests passed by direct execution. User now reports `npm start`, editing and guest rendering verified manually in VS Code. Go Live and task-picker interaction have not been separately confirmed. |
| SG-DOC01 — governance and living roadmap | DONE | Documentation-only changes; current `npm test` passed with 1 file-level pass, 0 failures. Direct `node tests/worker.test.js` passed all 8 named tests. Local Markdown links/task coverage and `git diff --check` checked before reporting. Awaiting user review. |

Latest automated baseline, rerun during SG-DOC01: eight tests cover create, SSR/noindex/no edit-token exposure, owner authorization, stable-address updates, escaping/field rejection, QR/card responses, QR dimensions/length limits and invalid/missing guides. The `npm test` file-level count is an observed reporting limitation in this environment; it is not an eight-test count. No production readiness, latency, QR decoding or complete security certification follows from these tests.

## Phases, tasks and dependencies

[IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md) is authoritative for detailed scope and acceptance criteria. Summaries below do not extend it. Explicit existing gates are SG-P00 first, P1 after SG-P00/SG-P01, decision approval before translation implementation, and all release gates plus approval before launch. Other dependency relationships below are planning prerequisites to confirm when approving each task, not approved reordering or architecture decisions. Each task also requires its own authorization.

| Phase | Task | Status | Scope summary and dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 — Repository and baseline | SG-P00 | DONE | Audit first; evidence above. |
| P0 | SG-P01 | NEXT | Minimal baseline fixes after audit. Recommended scope: safe saved-state parsing/validation, stale-response protection and focused regression checks. Not implemented; scope approval pending. |
| P1 — Warm host UI | SG-P10 | PLANNED | Design tokens and responsive host shell/sidebar; explicitly after SG-P00/SG-P01. |
| P1 | SG-P11 | PLANNED | Property tabs/cards/progress/actions using existing data; P0 gate applies; expected to build on SG-P10 shell. |
| P1 | SG-P12 | PLANNED | Compact accessible editing panel; P0 gate applies; coordinate with SG-P10/SG-P11 and saved-state behavior. |
| P2 — Guest UI and print | SG-P20 | PLANNED | Warm SSR guest layout; retain current guide model and non-JS reading. Confirm sequencing after baseline fixes. |
| P2 | SG-P21 | PLANNED | Print/QR screen and PNG/SVG exports; preserve stable guest URLs and prove QR decoding. Coordinate with SG-P20. |
| P2 | SG-P22 | PLANNED | A4/A5 welcome-book PDF from shared data; PDF approach remains open (D-013), with pagination/font verification required. Coordinate with SG-P20/SG-P21. |
| P3 — Feature completeness | SG-P30 | PLANNED | Photos and validated size variants; storage/photo policy decisions D-008/D-013 required before implementation choices. |
| P3 | SG-P31 | PLANNED | Multilingual architecture/cost comparison; research can precede decision D-009, implementation cannot. |
| P3 | SG-P32 | PLANNED | Multiple-account management, duplication and language settings; account ownership from SG-P41 and language direction from SG-P31 are prerequisites for corresponding behavior. Sequencing needs user review. |
| P4 — Commercial readiness | SG-P40 | PLANNED | True 24h trial/migration and abuse controls; D-011 lifecycle/ownership decisions and coordination with SG-P41 required. |
| P4 | SG-P41 | PLANNED | Secure accounts/sessions/recovery; D-011 authentication decision; coordinate with SG-P40 migration. |
| P4 | SG-P42 | PLANNED | Payment/tax research and approved billing integration; D-010 decision and verified ownership/trial lifecycle needed for integration. |
| P4 | SG-P43 | PLANNED | Monitoring, backup/restore, GDPR/legal and security review; review implemented account/trial/payment/storage behavior. |
| P5 — Launch | SG-P50 | PLANNED | Marketing/SEO, staging performance and pilot feedback; staging/external activity needs authorization and relevant safety controls. Final name remains open (D-012). |
| P5 | SG-P51 | BLOCKED | Production launch: all product/release gates, SG-P43 review, launch validation and explicit user authorization required. None is implied by prototype tests. |

Phase numbering is not permission to bypass dependencies. In particular SG-P32's account work crosses the current P3/P4 grouping; any reordering must be explicitly approved, with rationale documented. No reordering is approved here.

## Milestone completion criteria

These summarize the existing task acceptance criteria; they do not replace detailed definitions or authorize new scope.

| Milestone | Completion criteria |
|---|---|
| P0 | Audit evidenced; approved baseline fixes implemented with regression checks passing and diff reviewed. Audit alone does not complete P0. |
| P1 | SG-P10–SG-P12 accepted: responsive screenshots, preserved working flows, truthful saved-field state, keyboard/focus/save/error behavior verified. |
| P2 | SG-P20–SG-P22 accepted: SSR/noindex/non-JS reading and Wi-Fi copy, correctly decoded QR exports, A4/A5 pagination/fonts verified against shared content. |
| P3 | SG-P30–SG-P32 accepted: approved storage/translation choices, validated media, language behavior and authorized account ownership verified. |
| P4 | SG-P40–SG-P43 accepted with trial/auth/payment/privacy/monitoring/restore evidence and the [security gate](SECURITY.md) satisfied; tests alone are insufficient. |
| P5 | SG-P50 launch validation completed and SG-P51 gates passed; explicit production approval required before execution. |

## Open blockers and major risks

- **Production blocked:** temporary localStorage edit tokens, missing account recovery/revocation, trial expiry, abuse controls, billing verification, privacy/monitoring and tested restore remain launch gaps. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Host reliability:** audit found unguarded saved-state parsing and a possible stale-response race on property switching. SG-P01 is recommended, not completed. Drawer focus handling remains an accessibility issue for a separately approved scope.
- **Public content privacy:** editor currently lacks explicit safeguards against private entry information; escaping is not confidentiality protection.
- **Open decisions:** D-008–D-013 cover architecture/storage, translation cost/quotas, payment/tax viability, authentication/trial policy, name/domain conflict, PDF/photo policy and provisional discounts. No provider, purchase or architecture change is approved by this roadmap.
- **Verification gaps:** no real Cloudflare/D1 smoke test, measured field performance, QR decoding, physical print verification or comprehensive accessibility/security review. User-confirmed local flows do not close these gates.
- **Visual completeness:** reference photography, guest tiles/language switch, host sidebar and print workspace are targets, not implemented capabilities. Preserve speed and accessibility while approaching that direction.
- **Repository review:** prior developer-experience changes and current governance work remain uncommitted; do not overwrite them or assume a push occurred.
